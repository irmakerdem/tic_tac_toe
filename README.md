### Future Features
- Player can choose their token from a list of tokens
- When a win occurs, a straight line is shown on the winning sequence
- When a win occurs, confetti rains on the entire column of the winning player

### Reflection
- This hardest part about this project was creating a win function to work in the console.
- My initial plan was to have an array for the player which compares their choices to the winning combinations array. In order to make both players be able to do this, I created an array with two player instances inside. Unfortunately, the only way to make the win function work was to have 3 for loops which were nested which took me 9 hours to do (this was explicitly stated to not implement in the rubric).
- My second attempt was to hard code all the winning positions into the function instead of referring to it in the constructor of the Game instance. This method kind of worked but I had to adjust it. Unfortunately, I still had two separate winning functions and needed to refactor. The refactoring took some time to figure out but made the code very simple!
